# WiseFit  Proverbs Daily

A Fitbit OS application that displays a daily Bible verse from the book of Proverbs.

## 📖 About The Project

WiseFit is a simple and elegant application for your Fitbit device that provides you with a "Proverb of the Day". The chapter for the daily verse corresponds to the current day of the month. For example, on the 15th of the month, you'll get a random verse from Proverbs chapter 15.

Tap on the verse to explore the entire chapter and read all its verses in a scrollable list.

The scripture text is from the King James Version (KJV).
